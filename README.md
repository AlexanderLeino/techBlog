The goal of the project is to to allow the user to sign up or sign in. The logic is controlled by the npm package bcrypt. You can sign up and then once you sign up you can see other user blog posts. You can comment on a blog post and you can create your own posts as well. Once you create a post you can always edit or delete a post via the user dashboard.
